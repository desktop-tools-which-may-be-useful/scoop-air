# 🎐Air🎐

## Attention

This is a very personalized bucket, and many of the manifests installed in it are beta versions of the application with some preprocessing.

Many manifests rely on `scripts/AirUtils.psm1` and therefore cannot be used without this bucket installed.

Please check the manifests for changes and make sure they match your needs before installing.

## Usage

To add this bucket to scoop, run the following command in PowerShell:

```pwsh
scoop bucket add air https://github.com/desktop-tools-which-may-be-useful/scoop-air
```

> [!NOTE]
> The local bucket name doesn't have to be `air`. Manifest scripts locate the bucket dynamically at install time, so any name works (e.g. `scoop bucket add scoop-air ...` then `scoop install scoop-air/...`).

then

```pwsh
scoop install air/<manifestname>
```
